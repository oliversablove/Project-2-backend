This is a note-taking application I built as my second project for General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. It is a single-page application with working user authentication using a custom-built API. It can create, delete, update, and get all user notes.

I built the entirity of the application - including front-end and back-end.
This project is currently in its first version, and will be updated.

Project Development Process:
1. Build API
2. Build User Authentication
3. Build event handlers and CRUD callback functions
4. Add CSS

Problem Solving Strategy:
Every time I encountered problems I would try to break them down to solvable problems. As new programmer, I researched plenty to solve problems.

Problems to Fix/Long-term Goals:
1. I aim to use CSS and SASS to create an aesthetically appealing, user-friendly application.
2. I want to make the app more intuitive by adding small features like an dynamic edit button.

Technologies Used:
1. HTML
2. CSS, SASS & Bootstrap
3. JavaScript & jQuery
4. AJAX
5. Handlebars.js
6. Ruby
7. Ruby on Rails

User Stories:
1. As a user, I want to be able to write notes that only I can access so I can keep my thoughts private.
2. As a user, I want to be able to access all the notes I have written so I can remember and keep track of all of my ideas.
3. As a user, I want to be able to update a note incase I have more thoughts to add after I have already written it.
